                    I am Sagar Kushwaha, known in the gaming realm as Fallenblood, a seasoned Unity Game Developer and Programmer. My journey in the realm of game development spans five years, during which I've navigated through the intricacies of both 3D and 2D landscapes.
In my arsenal of coding languages, I wield the mighty C#, Python, and the agile Dart. Not content with just the coding arts, I've dabbled in the arcane arts of 3D modelling and sculpting, crafting immersive models. Flutter, a versatile tool in my inventory, has seen my forays into app development, adding another dimension to my skill set.
I've embarked on numerous quests, both solo and in fellowship with diverse teams. My passion lies not only in coding but in the collaborative dance of creativity and innovation.

May your code compile swiftly and your polygons be ever-optimized! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
